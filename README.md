Crystal Collector Game for HW4 UMN Bootcamp

The Crystal Collector Game automatically assigns hidden values to each of the crystals shown. The goal of the user is to match their current score to the random number given at the start of each game by adding up crystals. If they are able to match the scores, a success alert is shown and the win number increases. If they go over the random number, a failure alert is shown and the loss number increases. After the user wins or losses, a new random number is generated and each crystal is reassigned a hidden value.
